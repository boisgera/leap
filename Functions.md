TODO:

  - define a function "as usual" + function application (TODO: Python first)
    nota: functions are named.

  - define a function using the anonymous function syntax (Python lambda and
    its limitations : 1 expression, no statements, etc.)

    See where the type info can be put (or inferred).

  - functions are first-class values ...
  
  - ... then what is there types?

  - function with >=1 arguments, what is their types? Currying, 
    partial application, notation (associativity for -> and function application), 
    etc.

  - functions with 0 arguments :)

  - functions as arguments, example patterns

  - callables: coerce your types to functions

  - Shortcut centered dot

  - Bells and whistles: pattern matching

  - Bells and whistles: named arguments, default arguments, etc.

  - Bells and whistles: function composition, infix notation, etc.

  - Bells and whistles: currying, partial application, etc.

  - genericity, type arguments, implicit arguments, universe arguments, etc.

  - notation for type classes use?
