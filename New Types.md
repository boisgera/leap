TODO:

  - start with structure?

  - add "methods" and "fields" to a structure

  - builtin methods for structures

  - add "enums"

  - add "parametrized enums"

  - add "recursive enums" aka algebraic data types

  - mysterious examples : Nat, List and Tree in disguise

  - add "GADTs"

  - add "dependent types"



  - nota: see that structures are actually a special case of inductive types
