  - Imperative programming vs Functional programming

  - Python and Lean (deeper understanding of Python through the study of the differences!)

  - Lean for programming vs Lean for theorem proving (see Idris vs Agda/Rocq),

  - (HUGE in math imho)

  - (preparation for Lean as theorem prover)

  - Lean, imperative programming and the real world, / Lean functional programming.

  - Lean ADT -> GADT -> Dependent types

Limitations:

  - not a lot of API use

  - Lean is a "niche" language
