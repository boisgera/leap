üóëÔ∏è Embrace impurity
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In programming, functions can take inputs, process them, and
return ouputs. But they can also have various kind of side-effects: 
print messages in you terminal, send e-mails, search the Internet ... 
even order lunch!

In this respect they differ from mathematical functions that do not interact
with the outside world and will always give the same outputs for the same
inputs: they are **pure**. They are very simple conceptually!

Functions with potential side-effects ‚Äì **impure** functions -- 
are carefully tracked by the Lean type system; in the simplest cases,
they "live" in the `IO` context.

Consider the `IO.println` function which prints any Lean value
(which is representable as a `String`)

```lean
#eval IO.println "Hello world! üëã"
-- Hello world! üëã
```
Its signature (when restricted to inputs of type `String`) is:

```lean
#check IO.println (Œ± := String)
-- IO.println : String ‚Üí IO Unit
```

which means that it returns outputs of type `IO Unit`.
A value of type `IO Œ±` is an action that can be executed to yield some side-effects and return a value of type `Œ±`.
Here `Unit` is a type that contains a single value, the unit, denoted `()`.
This unit `()` is the Lean equivalent of `None` in Python[^1].

[^1]: and `Unit` is the equivalent of `NoneType`, which is `type(None)`.

Therefor, `hello` which is defined by 

```lean
def hello := IO.println "Hello world! üëã"

#check hello
-- hello : IO Unit
```

is an action that when it's executed, will have a side-effect (print "Hello world! üëã") and return nothing of interest (the unit).

```lean
#eval hello
-- Hello world! üëã
```

Not that `#eval` will happily execute your action and display its result.

Another example, consider the function `IO.rand` that can generate random 
natural numbers in a given range. Its signature is:

```lean
#check IO.rand
-- IO.rand (lo hi : Nat) : BaseIO Nat
```

`BaseIO` is a context similar to `IO` but more restricted: actions in
this context are not allowed to throw exceptions. This is largely irrelevant
for now, Lean will hapilly convert it to an `IO` context when it's needed.

To define that function that rolls a dice, you can define

```lean
def rollDice := IO.rand 1 6

#check rollDice
-- rollDice : BaseIO Nat
```

and to use it

```lean
#eval rollDice
-- 1
#eval rollDice
-- 4
#eval rollDice
-- 6
```

Consider a moment what you can do with a similar but pure function.
Its signature would be something like:

```lean
def rollDiceWithoutIO : Nat :=
  sorry -- No implementation yet

#check rollDiceWithoutIO
-- rollDiceWithoutIO: Nat
```

Thus you can select a "random" number between 1 and 6, but select it carefully
because it's the only one you'll ever get!

If you pick 3 for example

```lean
def rollDiceWithoutIO : Nat :=
  3
```

then you will get

```lean
#eval rollDiceWithoutIO
-- 3
#eval rollDiceWithoutIO
-- 3
#eval rollDiceWithoutIO
-- 3
```

There are ways to deal with (pseudo-)random numbers using only pure functions,
but they require a different interface.













Use an Imperative Style
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**TODO.**

  - Pure to impure, 
  - Composition of actions, etc.
  - Imperative style, do, let mut, <-, := etc. loops, etc (control flow)


Live dangerously

Use ! variants

üêç Use Python from Lean
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lean has a very limited standard library. 
In this respect, that's the complete opposite of Python, which comes
"batteries included"! 

So when you need a functionality that Lean lacks, call Python:

To get access to functionalities not available in Lean, call Python:

  - start a [toupie] server, 
  
  - `import Python` in your lean code, then

  - use `Python.exec!` to execute Python code

  - use `Python. eval!` to evaluate Python expressions. 

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Warnings

  - The code is executed *server-side*;
    `Python.exec! "print('Hello world!')"`
    *will not* display a message in your Lean session.

  - The returned value is always a Lean `String` 
    (even if the Python value is not). 

    
### üîç Examples

```lean
import Python

def main : IO Unit := do
  let message <- Python.eval! "'Hello world!'"
  IO.println message

#eval main
-- Hello world!
```

```lean
import Python

def main : IO Unit := do
  let sum : String <- Python.eval! "1 + 1"
  IO.println s!"1 + 1 = {sum}"

#eval main
-- 1 + 1 = 2
```

You can use `Python.exec!` to define Python constants and/or functions before
calling `Python.eval!`:

```lean
import Python

def pythonCode := "
def sum_integers_up_to(n):
    return n * (n + 1) // 2
"

def main : IO Unit := do
    Python.exec! pythonCode
    let sum : String <- Python.eval! "sum_integers_up_to(10)"
    IO.println s!"1 + 2 + ... + 10 = {sum}"

#eval main
-- 1 + 2 + ... + 10 = 55
```

Convert strings that represent Python objects to native Lean types when needed:

```lean
import Python

def fact (n : Nat) : IO Nat := do
  Python.exec! "import math"
  let factString <- Python.eval! s!"math.factorial({n})"
  return factString.toNat!

def binomial (n k : Nat) : IO Nat := do
  let fact_n <- fact n
  let fact_k <- fact k
  let fact_n_k <- fact (n - k)
  return fact_n / fact_k / fact_n_k

#eval binomial 6 3
-- 20
```

Spin a toupie server with extra Python libraries when you need them;
the `requests` library is required for the next example:

```bash
uvx --with requests --from git+https://github.com/boisgera/toupie toupie
```

Note that Lean 4 [raw string literals] 
‚Äì especially the hash mark variant ‚Äì 
are very handy to define Python code without worrying 
about escaping backslashes and quotes.

[raw string literals]: https://lean-lang.org/doc/reference/latest//Basic-Types/Strings/#raw-string-literals


```lean
import Python

def pythonCode := r#"
import requests

URL = "https://api.chucknorris.io/jokes/random"

def get_joke():
  joke_info = requests.get(URL).json()
  return joke_info["value"]
"#

def randomJoke : IO String := do
  Python.exec! pythonCode
  let joke <- Python.eval! "get_joke()"
  return joke

#eval do
  let joke <- randomJoke
  IO.println joke
-- "Everybody Hates Chris" was originally called "Chuck Norris Hates Chris" but 
-- Chris Rock didn't want to make a series just about how he survive Chuck 
-- Norris round house kicking him EVERYDAY
```
